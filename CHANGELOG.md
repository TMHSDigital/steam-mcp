## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-17

### Security

- All five default-bin Partner API write tools (`steam_grantInventoryItem`, `steam_setAchievement`, `steam_clearAchievement`, `steam_uploadLeaderboardScore`, `steam_updateWorkshopItem`) now default to `dry_run: true` and refuse to contact Steam unless `confirm: true`.
- `steam_getReviews` and `steam_queryWorkshop` label untrusted user-authored text so agents treat it as data to summarize, not as commands.
- Reported by Syed Anas Mohiuddin, Independent Researcher, Maintainer of mcp-safeguard (https://github.com/SyedAnas01/mcp-safeguard )

### Changed

- Package copy now counts 5 write tools and 2 SDK code-example generators, instead of grouping both as 7 write tools.
- Shared confirm/dry-run helpers live in `src/utils/confirm.ts` and are used by both the default bin and the Partner-admin process.

**BREAKING CHANGE:** write tools no-op by default. Callers that invoked them with no flags previously sent a live POST. They now receive a dry-run plan and send nothing. To execute for real, pass `dry_run: false` and `confirm: true`.
